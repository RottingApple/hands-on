-- A multicolumn B-tree index can be used with query conditions that involve any subset of the index's columns, 
-- but the index is most efficient when there are constraints on the leading (leftmost) columns. 
-- The exact rule is that equality constraints on leading columns, plus any inequality constraints on the first column 
-- that does not have an equality constraint, will be used to limit the portion of the index that is scanned. 
-- Constraints on columns to the right of these columns are checked in the index, so they save visits to the table proper, 
-- but they do not reduce the portion of the index that has to be scanned. For example, given an index on (a, b, c) 
-- and a query condition WHERE a = 5 AND b >= 42 AND c < 77, the index would have to be scanned from the first entry 
-- with a = 5 and b = 42 up through the last entry with a = 5. Index entries with c >= 77 would be skipped, 
-- but they'd still have to be scanned through. This index could in principle be used for queries that have constraints on b 
-- and/or c with no constraint on a — but the entire index would have to be scanned, so in most cases the planner would 
-- prefer a sequential table scan over using the index.
